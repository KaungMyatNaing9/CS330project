# A Security device

## What is this project about?
In our offices or homes there are some kinds of security installation that has a keypad and an engine to decide either locking or unlocking the device depending on what user input is. As from the real life, the keypad has numbers varies from 0 to 9 and the security device will unlock or lock if the inputs are definitely same with the access code you have set before. In this project I set the lock code as 993064 and unlocking code as 993061. The purpose of this project is to use Finite Automata concepts to solve this problem.
